# PointMe
PointMe is a World of Warcraft plugin that allows you to "sync" map pins with party members automatically. If users in the same party have the plugin installed, any map pin placed will place the same pin on all other party member's maps.

# Features
- Map pins sync to party members automatically
- Map pins auto-track when placed
- Deleting of map pins is synced as well

# Todo List
- Upload it to curse or similar
- Fix issue: it sends an extra message back when you set a pin (currently it sends it, and then recieves it back once)
- Fix issue: setting map pins quickly caused it to loop and set a bunch of pins 
- Add multiple pins and allow syncing them all (potentially color coding them to the class color?) - https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mappinenhanced
